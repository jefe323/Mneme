Mneme
=====

This is a simple program that enables a user to quickly get commonly used data onto their clipboard to avoid re-typing data constantly. Think of it as Autocomplete for every application a user has on their desktop. The application stores the saved data in an XML file that is located in the same directory as the executable file. I like naming my random programs after Greek mythology (Mneme is the muse of memory).

Thanks to citricsquid for bringing up the idea.
